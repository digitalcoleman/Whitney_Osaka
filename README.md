Stills from my re-creation.

Made for Zach Leiberman's Reconstructing the Past Course at SFPC. This ended up being really interesting - the puzzle of figuring out how it was done was the real work, the execution was quick. I used ofxBlur to get a nice glow. I didnâ€™t have time to code the timing and so used a MidiFighter Twister knob to control the speed during playback - it took several tries to get it even close to right.
